                    <p>Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.</p>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>1) Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics.</li>
                <li>2) Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable.</li>
                <li>3) In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University.</li>

                <ul class="py-4">
                <li>1)When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. </li>
                <li>2)The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.</li>
                <li>3)Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.</li>

                <ul class="py-4">
                    <li>1) Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,[116] while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). </li>
                    <li>2) He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.</li>
                    <li>3) Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own".</li>

                    <li>1) In January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch.</li>
                    <li>2) On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police.</li>

                    <li>1) On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day at the age of 41.</li>
                    <li>2) Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.</li>
